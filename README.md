## FE & BE Developer üëã
My development experience, which has been consistently carried out with passion and creativity, will always deliver only clear and perfect results to you.
My philosophy is to secure everything with skills, and I am still struggling with this.
My passion for programs will always bring you only satisfaction.
My way of working is that every process in a program should be well documented from the start so that the results are clear and accurate.

"Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) is a software development principle that aims to reduce the repetition of information that is likely to change.
